# healthCareAnalysis

We would like to explore the dataset of hospitals and clinics against the areas of population concentration across California. Our end goal is to find whether people in California have equal and convenient access to healthcare by analyzing the quality of hospitals and distance between residents to hospitals in different territories. We plan to look at data of residents and hospitals in each zip code. 

We expect to find that not everyone in California has equal and convenient access to quality healthcare. There will likely be areas where hospitals are far from a convenient distance to residents. More importantly, residents may have access to healthcare but it may not be the best quality or fit for their needs. This brings up the importance of our analysis, to see if we can determine the exact areas of residents who are not able to access healthcare as readily as others. Especially in light of the recent Coronavirus situation, allocating convenient healthcare to citizens of California can help treat and stop the spread of the disease.

The business case for our analysis can be utilized by healthcare providers and urban designers in the government to determine how to create accessible healthcare for all. Large healthcare corporations can use this data to find out where to build their next hospital. They can also determine which existing hospitals would require an upgrade to their services.
Our audience would be the residents that are not receiving accessible and quality healthcare. They can use this data to either relocate, or support the construction of new hospitals in their area.
